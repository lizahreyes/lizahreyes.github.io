					<p>
						I am currently in my final year of the Nutrition and Food program at Ryerson University, and will be applying for a post-graduate internship for the following year. Before I started at Ryerson, I had completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto. From there, my interest in nutrition grew and drove my further interest in wanting to become a Registered Dietitian.
