			 <p>Diane is my younger sister and she has greatly inspired my involvement in the field of food and nutrition.  At a very young age, we found out that Diane had a variety of food allergies including: dairy products, seafood, nuts, and eggs.  Although food allergies have become a more well-known thing nowadays, they were not so recognized ~20 years ago and at that time my family and I had no idea what challenges were ahead of us.</p>  

			<p>These recipes are near-and-dear to my heart because they are the ones (of many, many recipes) that Diane approves of!  Itâ€™s hard to make good-tasting food with so many recipe restrictions so when Diane likes something I make - it means SO much to me.  If you or someone you know has similar allergies, I hope you find these recipes helpful and enjoy them as well!</p>
