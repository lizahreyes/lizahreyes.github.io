<div class="intro">
	<p>These recipes are near-and-dear to my heart because they are the ones (of many recipes) that Diane approves of!  Itâ€™s hard to make good-tasting food with so many dietary restrictions so when Diane likes something I make - it means a lot to me.  If you or someone you know has similar allergies, I hope you find these recipes helpful and enjoy them as well! </p>
