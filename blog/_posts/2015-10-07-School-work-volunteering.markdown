This week I had the pleasure of volunteering at a large community event where multiple organizations had showcased the programs that were available to their community members.  I worked at Unison’s Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) booth to share diabetes-related information and to assist individuals in determining their risk for developing diabetes.  It is a great feeling to share my knowledge with others who aren’t well-versed in this area, to give them the information that they need to make informed decisions about food and nutrition.  
In addition, I got to meet a new volunteer that I coincidentally already work with.  What a great way to end my week, with a new friend!
