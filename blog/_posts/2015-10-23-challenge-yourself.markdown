Hello dear readers!  I hope you are all enjoying the transition from spring to fall.  This is my favourite time of the year because mother nature shows off her ability to wow us with breathtaking views of the outdoors.  In particular, this morning I watched the most beautiful sunrise behind the Toronto skyline.  It was the first time in a long time where I took a moment of silence to enjoy the view and sit back and witness nature at it’s best. 

Besides my recent fascination of looking at the sky -- partly due to my astronomy course -- I wanted to share with you my newest experiences. 
I now volunteer with the in-store dietitian at Superstore in Milton; 
Started visiting patients in the bariatric clinic and will have my own patients soon;
Am a recipient a Jennifer Welsch scholarship from the School of Nutrition at Ryerson

I already have so much going on but I believe that continuously challenging yourself is the best way to improve. Like a quote I heard in class recently “Challenge yourself and nobody else”
