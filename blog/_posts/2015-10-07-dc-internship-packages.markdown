This week has been amazingly stressful to say the least.  To sum it up quickly, the 2016 DC internship application packages have just come out and it has all upper year nutrition students on edge.  The School of Nutrition at Ryerson is being super supportive in providing workshops, and I am regretfully reflecting back on this time last year.  Where was I and why was I not attending the workshops?  Either way, time is my only enemy at this point so wish me luck!
