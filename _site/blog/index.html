        </h2>

    	<p>This week has been amazingly stressful to say the least.  To sum it up quickly, the 2016 DC internship application packages have just come out and it has all upper year nutrition students on edge.  The School of Nutrition at Ryerson is being super supportive in providing workshops, and I am regretfully reflecting back on this time last year.  Where was I and why was I not attending the workshops?  Either way, time is my only enemy at this point so wish me luck!</p>

        </h2>

    	<p>This week I had the pleasure of volunteering at a large community event where multiple organizations had showcased the programs that were available to their community members.  I worked at Unison’s Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) booth to share diabetes-related information and to assist individuals in determining their risk for developing diabetes.  It is a great feeling to share my knowledge with others who aren’t well-versed in this area, to give them the information that they need to make informed decisions about food and nutrition.<br />
In addition, I got to meet a new volunteer that I coincidentally already work with.  What a great way to end my week, with a new friend!</p>

    	<p>Starting this new school year was very different.  If you didn’t already know, I originally come from Winnipeg, MB (where I grew up!).  After a very good friend of mine moved back home this year, I realized that many of my close friends live in different cities now (Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, and in Ann Arbor (Michigan)).  I wanted to share my passion of food &amp; trying new things with these friends, so I started a new mission: recipe food challenge (long-distance).  Every month we choose one recipe to make, and then we all share our experiences of making it + pictures!  Here are the out photos from our first set of recipes:</p>
